The functions provided in this package allow to analyse data from the US
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting
System. That is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data
regarding fatal injuriees suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashed.

The two functions at hand are `fars_summarize_years` and `fars_map_state`.
While the former allows viewing a summary of incidents by month in tabular
form, the latter plots a map of incidents.
